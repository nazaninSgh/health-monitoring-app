# Health Monitoring App

## Overview

The Health Monitoring App is designed to track and display health metrics such as heart rate, temperature, and humidity. Data is collected using an Arduino connected to sensors and simulated in Proteus. The collected data is then transmitted to an Android app via Bluetooth for real-time monitoring and display.

## Features

- **Heart Rate Monitoring**: Measures and tracks heart rate.
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Records and displays body temperature.
- **Humidity Monitoring**: Monitors and reports humidity levels.
- **Bluetooth Data Transmission**: Sends data from Arduino to the Android app via Bluetooth for real-time updates.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Arduino**
- **Proteus Simulator**
- **Bluetooth Module**
- **Android App**

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Sensors connected to the Arduino measure heart rate, temperature, and humidity.
2. **Simulation**: Proteus Simulator is used to test and validate the system's behavior.
3. **Data Transmission**: Collected data is sent via Bluetooth from the Arduino to the Android app.
4. **Real-Time Monitoring**: The Android app displays the health metrics in real-time for user monitoring.
